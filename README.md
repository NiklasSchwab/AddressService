# Address Service - A gRPC demo project
This "Address Service" is a simple application with a server written in Go and clients written in Python and Go. Server and clients communicate with gRPC calls.

This is my own personal project to get familiar with different features of gRPC and how to use it in different languages.
This code will also be for demonstrating gRPC during the summer semester 2022 seminar at the Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences.
