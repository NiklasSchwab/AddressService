# Address Service - A gRPC demo project
This "Address Service" is a simple application with a server written in Go and a client written in Python _(more clients in different languages are plannend)_. Server and clients communicate with gRPC calls.

This is my own personal project to get familiar with different features of gRPC and how to use it in different languages.
